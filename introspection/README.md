Why must we choose you? 

Even though i know only jst one programming language(Java which  i studied in 11th and 12th) and tat too jst covered my school portions.. i love coding and solving problems. Since the club has a lot of experienced and knowledgable people, I could help myself in learning and improving my knowledge. There are a lot of "off" things about me which I could probably overcome if I join amFOSS. Main problrm is tat i hav a hell lot of stage fear and i cannot talk to mass audiance and i think, Spending time with different people might help, ANd i would like to make new friends with same interests and to work together with them ..helping each othere

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

To be honest..i havnt planned much..jst want to graduate with min CGPA of 8.5 and get placed in good companies

How would you contribute back to the club?

I will help my upcoming juniors or any person if they face any difficulty in the topics tat i know and wil also contiously support the club through my life

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

I think tat this kind of selection process gives a great learning experience to whosoever who attempt the tasks even for very beginner and my suggestion would be that the selection process could include looking into the individual's previous knowledge and achievements as well and give tasks based on them too.
